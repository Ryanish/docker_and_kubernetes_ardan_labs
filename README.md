## Intensive Docker and Kubernete's courses

---


This repo contains the material I used and/or produced via the Intensive Docker 2.0 and Intensive Kubernetes 2.0 Ardan Labs courses, ran by Jerome Petazzoni. A fantastic tutor and a brilliant place to either start from or act as a great refresher for those rusty with these tools.

Each course spans 16 hours of content and is available in a bundle for $499. I would happily recommend managers and leaders consider expensing this to help strengthen their teams foundational knowledge and approach to platform usage. It can really change the perspective on what "good" looks like.
